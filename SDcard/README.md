# SAFEZEN.txt

Every Zen device requires an SD card to work. On that SD card there should be a 
file named SAFEZEN.txt with personal settings.

There are 3 example files, the minimal required settings is device_id 
(see [SAFEZEN_minimal.txt](SAFEZEN_minimal.txt)). Device id must be greater than 0 to work

Other settings can be added, see [SAFEZEN_all_settings.txt](SAFEZEN_all_settings.txt) 
for full options.

All settings can be changed (or will be added later) in the config screen of the device. 

More info will be added in this readme at a later time.
